# Responsive Website Project

## Overview

This project focuses on making the website fully responsive, improving code quality, and restructuring the file organization. The goal was to ensure the website renders well on all devices, including mobile and tablets, by implementing responsive design principles. Additionally, I have divided the homepage into smaller, modular components to improve maintainability, and added animations using `framer-motion` for a better user experience.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adjusts its layout for various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  
- **Component-based Structure**: The homepage has been broken down into several smaller, reusable components for better scalability and readability. Each section of the page is a separate React component that can be easily modified or reused elsewhere.

- **Improved Code Quality**: The code was refactored to improve its clarity, modularity, and maintainability. This ensures better readability, reduces redundancy, and makes it easier for future developers to work on the project.

- **Framer Motion Animations**: To enhance the user experience, I added smooth animations using the `framer-motion` library. These animations provide a polished feel to the interactions without overwhelming the user.

## File Structure

I followed a clear and organized folder structure for the project, ensuring easy navigation and better maintainability.
